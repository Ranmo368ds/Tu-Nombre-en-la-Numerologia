                "question": "How does Storm Intelligence Targeting work?",

With that we activate local campaigns only in those areas: direct mail, Google Ads, and visual presence. This means when the homeowner receives your ad, the damage already exists or is very likely."

                "question": "Do I need service-specific pages on my website?",

            "q3": {
                "question": "What works better: post-storm campaigns or general campaigns?",
                "answer": "Post-storm campaigns based on NOAA data have higher effectiveness because you talk to homeowners who likely have real damage. General campaigns work for preventive maintenance and planned replacements."
